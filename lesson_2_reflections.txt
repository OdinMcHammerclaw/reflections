- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You creat a .git file that is hidden, but will begin tracking commits of files added to it. It needs to be done in order for commits and other Git functions to work.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory & the repository are both finalized locations, the staging area is a good place to see which files you might want to add or drop from the commit before making the commit.
