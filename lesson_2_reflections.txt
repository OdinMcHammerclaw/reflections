- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You creat a .git file that is hidden, but will begin tracking commits of files added to it. It needs to be done in order for commits and other Git functions to work.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory & the repository are both finalized locations, the staging area is a good place to see which files you might want to add or drop from the commit before making the commit.

- How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can view which files are ready to be added to the commit and which files are not. You can also drop any files that are not part of the logical change.
