-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime you or others need to access the files to colaborate or work remotly you would want to keep your work in a remote repository.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You wont always want to pull down ALL changes made on GitHub. For instance someone might add a file that you think isn't going to work within your project. If it automatically pulled the file would be in your local instance without you wanting it there.
